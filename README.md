# Playing in Heavy Traffic
### Graphics Final Project
Playing in heavy traffic simulator. Has a professor ever told you to play in heavy traffic after asking about your grade? Well, now you can! From the safety of your computer, you too can play in heavy traffic. 

Your goal is to cross a given area without getting hit by on coming traffic. We put a fun spin on it by allowing the user to customize there character before they play the game. They can either chose between some preset characters or build a full custom character.
