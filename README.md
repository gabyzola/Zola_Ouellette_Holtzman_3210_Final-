# Playing in Heavy Traffic
### Graphics Final Project

This project is like crossy road where your goal is to cross a given area without getting hit by on coming traffic. We put a fun spin on it by allowing the user to customize there character before they play the game. They can either chose between some preset characters or build a full custom character.
